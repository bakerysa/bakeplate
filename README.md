|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Responsive boilerplate | A responsive boilerplate optimized for the multi-screen web.                     |
| Sass support                           | Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) into CSS with ease, bringing support for variables, mixins and more. (Run `gulp serve` or `gulp` for production)                                                                                                      |
| Performance optimization               | Minify and concatenate JavaScript, CSS, HTML and images to help keep your pages lean. (Run `gulp` to create an optimised version of your project to `/dist`)                                                                                                |
| Code Linting               | JavaScript code linting is done using [ESLint](http://eslint.org) - a pluggable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.                                                                                                |
| ES2015 via Babel 6.0                   | Optional ES2015 support using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). To enable ES2015 support remove the line `"only": "gulpfile.babel.js",` in the [.babelrc](.babelrc) file. ES2015 source code will be automatically transpiled to ES5 for wide browser support.  |
| Built-in HTTP Server                   | A built-in server for previewing your site locally while you develop and iterate                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Live Browser Reloading                 | Reload the browser in real-time anytime an edit is made without the need for an extension. (Run `gulp serve` and edit your files)                                                                                                                           |
| Cross-device Synchronization           | Synchronize clicks, scrolls, forms and live-reload across multiple devices as you edit your project. Powered by [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io). (Run `gulp serve` and open up the IP provided on other devices on your network)                       |
| Offline support                     | Thanks to our baked in [Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/) [pre-caching](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/master/gulpfile.babel.js#L226), sites deploying `dist` to a HTTPS domain will enjoy offline support. This is made possible by [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/).                                                                                                                                              |
| PageSpeed Insights                     | Web performance metrics showing how well your site performs on mobile and desktop (Run `gulp pagespeed`)                                                                                                                                                    |

### Speed Index

Test the speed index of your code or project. (1000 is ideal.)

### Inspiration
